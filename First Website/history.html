    <h1>An Italian Icon: the Vespa</h1>
    <p class = "tHistory">
        The Vespa was created in 1946 in Pontedera, Italy, after World War 2. Due to
        the catastrophic state the war left Italy in, automobile and other vehicle
        manufacturers were struggling to get back on their feet. Roads were destroyed,
        and Italians needed a new means of transportation. Enrico Piaggio currated the idea for a 2
        wheeled vehicle that would be reliable and inexpensive to make. The Piaggio
        family was involved in the aerospace industry, so the first vespa was made from
        spare aircraft parts. Corradino D'Ascanio designed the vehicle, and due to his unique
        design and its sound, it was named "Vespa" (Italian for wasp). It quickly gained
        popularity throughout Europe, and made its way all around the world. The Vespa is not only a
        popular means of transport, but also is a representation of the fruit of life and a symbol of fashion.
